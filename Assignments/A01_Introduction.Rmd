## 1) Discussion Questions

1. What are your previous experiences with data analytics, R, and Git? Include both formal and informal training.

> Answer: I have done research and internships that have required data analytics in Excel.  I have also taken two college-level courses in Python which have focused somewhat on data analytics.  In one of the classes, I learned how to use Git.  Lastly, I was introduced to R in my Data Analysis class at Duke. Since then, I have used it for research and my Masters Project.

2. Are there any components of the course about which you feel confident?

> Answer: I feel confident in using Git and in my data cleaning skills.

3. Are there any components of the course about which you feel apprehensive?

> Answer: Maybe not apprehensive, but I'm looking forward to learning new data wrangling and visualization skills.  I am a bit worried about creating a good final project.
